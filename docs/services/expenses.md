How much does it cost to run Chilled Adventures?

:::info
Chilled Adventures started as a hobby and still is to this day, I enjoy working on the server for the community to grow larger. Though with running a server comes costs and as the community grows it costs more to run, this is where we ask our community to donate to keep up with the costs. - Fantom, Owner of Chilled Adventures.

## Hosting Costs

Every month the server costs about £24 for hosting, this is £20 for the server, £4 for the website and email hosting. We optimise the server as well as possible so that we can stay with these costs for longer, but money doesn't magically appear, thats why donations are asked to keep up the running costs. This comes to about £288 a year just for hosting.

We also have spend quite a bit on development, plugins which allow the features we have on the server to happen and stay in a good running order.

We ask that you only donate if you truly wish to support the server, and don't let Chilled Adventures become a financial burden for you.

If you would like to donate we will have a store open once the revamp is released so for now please donate through paypal.
