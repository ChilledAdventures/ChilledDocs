# ChilledDocs
Chilled Adventures Documentation

Hey welcome to the GitHub page for ChilledDocs, a place for Chilled Adventures Minecraft server players to find out what does what!

## Wondering why there is no html?
We work with Markdown on this site so its easy for the Chilled Adventures staff to understand and commit to the docs, when netlify detects a repo update it will build and create the html static files for the online build from the provided markdown files.

## Want to contribute?
Soon there will be information on how to contribute and a sytax guide.
Guide link for now: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
